# flask_5_tailwind

To create de CDN in Azure I followed in class indications. Containers and video upload was completed in class with the professor indications. 

I managed to sucessfully upload and run the video from cdn-azure but unfortunately had issues with the video at the time of running the flask app. I appears together with the data but it does not play. Flask app runs perfectly. 

Screenshot were added to show the video sucefully running from the cdn-azure.
